Description: Development libraries to develop applications that utilize control groups
 Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of tasks,
 and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with specialized
 behaviour.
 .
 It provides API to create/delete and modify cgroup nodes. It will also in the
 future allow creation of persistent configuration for control groups and
 provide scripts to manage that configuration.
